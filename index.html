			Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time,<br>
			to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.The concept of space is considered to be of<br>
			fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers<br>
			over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.<br>
